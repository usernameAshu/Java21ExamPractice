2. Given a map of Name and Salary, Group employees based on salary.
i/p: {John: 1000, Jane: 1500, Doe: 1000, Smith: 2000} => o/p: {1000: [John, Doe], 1500: [Jane], 2000: [Smith]}

//NetCracker (OSS Support wing)

//Koch Industries
Round 1 & Round 2 (technical)
1. Given an array of Integers, rotate the array by 'k' elements.
i/p: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and k = 3 => o/p: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

2. Given a list of Employees, where each Employee has salary & designation. Both are integers.
Find the employee with least designation. Least designation is 0, maximum is 10.
If you have multiple employees with the same designation,
then find the employee with the highest salary.
i/p: [{1000, 5}, {1500, 3}, {2000, 5}, {2500, 3}, {3000, 5}] => o/p: {2500, 3}

Answer: When the HashMap is full, the load factor is increased and the size of the HashMap is doubled.
7. How it affects the key-value pair in the HashMap?
Answer: The key-value pair is stored in the bucket of the HashMap. When the HashMap is full,
the bucket is increased and the key-value pair is stored in the new bucket.
8. What is key rehashing?
Answer: When the HashMap is full, the key rehashing is done to store the key-value pair in the new bucket.

//Shell Recharge
Round 1: Coding round (HackerRank)
1. Given a integer array jumps, where each jumps says you have to go up or down.
Return the minimum starting stair, so that at any jump you don't go below 1.
Example: jumps array: [1,-2, -4, 3] => o/p: 6 (starting stair)
Demo:
starting stair    Jump
6                  1
7                  -2
5                  -4
1                  3
4
So, it means you have to start from 6th stair, so that you don't go below 1.

//Netcracker (OSS R&D wing)
Round 1: Technical discussions
-Questions from core Java 
-HashMap question:
Having a employee objects as keys (with equals and HashCode overridden)
Then we change the employee-key here and try to fetch the values from Hashmat using the same key.
We are checking whether the key exists in the map. 
How does it impacts the HashMap ? (Hint: memory leak, since key's hashcode is modified, map won't have that new key, and the old key is not reachable)
-Given a set, we are iterating a set and modifying the elements
How the set will behave ?  -> ConcurrentModificationException
How to mitigate it in a set ?
You can use Iteratorâ€™s remove() method -it's safe for single threaded app
Or use CopyOnWriteArraySet -> when it's a multiple threaded environment 
-DBMS code, where we are manually trying to connect to database using Connection API.
In that code, it's using Statement. 
Do we need to use PreparedStatement ? What is the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement ?
-Algo question
Return all the unique pairs from integer list, whose sum is equal to target sum.
